2. Code: Tasks Spacy can perform

Day 5
Challenge: 3 groups of text are given.
From text group 1,
1.	identify entities (person, place, thing, location)
2.	Categorize them into ‘living entity’, ‘person’ or ‘object’. 
From text group 2,
1.	Identify main words or topics mentioned in the corpus.
From text group 3,
1.	Analyse the sentiment of each of the sentences
2.	Use a model to extract the answer to a question from the corpus.
